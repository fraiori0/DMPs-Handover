# DMPs-Handover
This ROS package includes nodes for the online generation of end-effector's trajectories (position and orientation) using Dynamical Movements Primitives (for position) and a quaternion-based dynamical system (for orientation). It also contains specialized code that include coupling terms to be used for movement coordination in robot-human handover scenarios.

## Notes
The package is now still in a preliminary version, and is being used for the control of a UR5 robot with a variation of the cartesian_controllers package, originally developed by Stefan Scherzinger. As such, part of the code may be not relevant for general use.
